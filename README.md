Hello, everyone!

We've developed a song recommendation system utilizing Spotify data and user listening habits. 
Our primary goal was to leverage users' listening habits while also collecting data directly from the users themselves. 
This approach enables us to recommend songs tailored to their personal tastes. 
The project was built using Python and its libraries (such as tkinter, spotipy, etc.).

Our project aims to achieve the following:

1.Provide a more personalized experience for users.
2.Assist users in discovering songs that align with their unique preferences.
3.Enhance the overall experience of music apps like Spotify, making it more seamless.
4.Simplify the process of recommending songs based on their favorite artists or beloved tracks.

This project was a collaborative effort among my colleagues and me."
